    "solution": "The continuity of $T(x)$ is obvious since it is defined as the series of continuous functions converging uniformly. To show the non-differentiability it suffices to consider any point $x$ in the interval $(0, 1]$ since $T(x)$ is periodic with period 1.\n\nWe first consider any point $x$ which can be expressed in the form $k/2^m$ with some odd integer $k$ and non-negative integer $m$. For any integer $n \\geq m$ put $h_n = 1/2^n$ for brevity. Then for any integer $\\ell$ in $[0, n]$ there are no integers nor half-integers in the interval $(2^\\ell x, 2^\\ell(x + h_n))$. For if $2^\\ell x < p/2 < 2^\\ell x + 2^\\ell h_n$ for some integer $p$, then we would have $2^n x = k 2^{n-m} < 2^{n-\\ell-1} p < k 2^{n-m} + 1$, a contradiction. This means that $g(x)$ is a linear function having the slope 1 or $-1$ on this subinterval. Hence\n\\[\n\\frac{T(x + h_n) - T(x)}{h_n} = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^\\infty \\frac{g(2^\\ell (x + h_n)) - g(2^\\ell x)}{2^\\ell h_n} = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{n-1} \\frac{g(2^\\ell x + 2^\\ell h_n) - g(2^\\ell x)}{2^{\\ell-n}}\n\\]\nis a finite sum of 1 or $-1$, which does not converge as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nNext consider any point $x$ for which $2^n x$ is not an integer for all positive integer $n$. Since $2^n x$ is not an integer, we can find two positive numbers $h_n$ and $h_n'$ satisfying $[2^n x] = 2^n (x - h_n')$ and $[2^n x] + 1 = 2^n (x + h_n)$. Note that $h_n + h_n' = 2^{-n}$. Then for any integer $\\ell$ in $[0, n]$ there are no integers nor half-integers in the interval $(2^\\ell (x - h_n'), 2^\\ell (x + h_n))$. For if $p/2$ were contained in this interval for some integer $p$, then we have $[2^n x] < 2^{n-\\ell-1} p < [2^n x] + 1$, a contradiction. Therefore\n\\[\n\\frac{T(x + h_n) - T(x - h_n')}{h_n + h_n'} = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^\\infty \\frac{g(2^\\ell (x + h_n)) - g(2^\\ell (x - h_n'))}{2^\\ell (h_n + h_n')} = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{n-1} \\frac{g(2^\\ell x + 2^\\ell h_n) - g(2^\\ell x - 2^\\ell h_n')}{2^{\\ell-n}}\n\\]\nis a finite sum of 1 or $-1$, which does not converge as $n \\to \\infty$."
