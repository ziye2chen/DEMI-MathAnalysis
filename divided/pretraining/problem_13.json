    "solution": "For any $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists an integer $N$ satisfying\n\\[\n-\\epsilon < f(x+1) - f(x) < \\epsilon\n\\]\nfor any $x > N$. Summing the following $\\ell = \\lfloor x \\rfloor - N$ inequalities\n\\[\n-\\epsilon < f(x-j+1) - f(x-j) < \\epsilon\n\\]\nfor $j = 1, \\ldots, \\ell$ and for $x \\geq N+1$ we get\n\\[\n-\\epsilon(\\lfloor x \\rfloor - N) < f(x) - f(x-\\ell) < \\epsilon(\\lfloor x \\rfloor - N).\n\\]\nSince $N \\leq x - \\ell < N+1$, it follows from this that\n\\[\n-M - \\epsilon(x - N + 1) < f(x) < M + \\epsilon(x - N),\n\\]\nwhere $M$ is the maximum of $|f(x)|$ on $[N, N+1]$. Therefore\n\\[\n\\frac{|f(x)|}{x} < \\frac{M + \\epsilon(x - N + 1)}{x} < \\epsilon + \\frac{M}{x},\n\\]\nwhich implies that $|f(x)/x| < 2\\epsilon$ for any $x > \\max\\{N+1, M/\\epsilon\\}$.\n\nTo show the latter half of the problem put\n\\[\ng_x(y) = \\sup_{t \\geq x} |f(t+y) - f(t)|,\n\\]\nwhich converges to $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ for an arbitrary fixed $y$. If $g_x(y_0) > s$, then there exists $t_0 \\geq x$ satisfying $|f(t_0+y_0) - f(t_0)| > s$. By the continuity of $f$, we have $|f(t+y) - f(t)| > s$ for any $(t, y)$ sufficiently close to $(t_0, y_0)$. This means that $g_x(y) > s$ for any $y$ sufficiently close to $y_0$; in other words, the set\n\\[\n\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R} : g_x(y) > s\\}\n\\]\nis an open set. Hence $\\{g_n(y)\\}$ is a sequence of Borel measurable functions converging pointwise to $0$. By Egoroff's theorem we can find a measurable set $F \\subset [-1, 1]$ whose measure is greater than $3/2$ such that $g_n(y)$ converges to $0$ uniformly on $F$; therefore for any $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists an integer $N$ satisfying $g_n(y) < \\epsilon$ for any $n > N$ and any $y \\in F$. By the theorem due to Steinhaus (1920) there exists an interval $I$ such that any point $y$ in $I$ can be expressed as $y = u - v$ with $u, v \\in F \\cap (-F)$, since the measure of $F \\cap (-F)$ is positive. Clearly $-y$ has such an expression, and we can assume that $I$ is contained in the positive real axis. For any non-negative $x$ we have\n\\[\ng_n(x+x') = \\sup_{t \\geq n} |f(t+x+x') - f(t)| \\leq \\sup_{t \\geq n} |f(t+x) - f(t)| + \\sup_{t \\geq n} |f(t+x') - f(t+x)| = g_n(x) + g_n(x').\n\\]\nApplying the above inequality to $y = u - v \\in I$ we get\n\\[\ng_n(y) = g_n(u-v) \\leq g_n(u) + g_n(-v) < 2\\epsilon,\n\\]\nsince the case does not occur in which both $u$ and $-v$ are negative. This implies that $\\{g_n(y)\\}$ converges to $0$ uniformly on the interval $I$. This is also true on any set consisting of finite parallel translations of $I$ since $g_n(x+x') \\leq g_n(x) + g_n(x')$ for any $x \\in I$ and $x'$."
