    "problem": "Show that any continuous convex function $f(x)$ on an open interval $I$ possesses a finite derivative except for at most countable points.",
    "problem_type": "Convex Functions",
    "solution": "Let \\( f'_+(x) \\) and \\( f'_-(x) \\) be the right- and left-hand derivatives of \\( f \\) at \\( x \\) respectively. First we will prove that \\( f'_\\pm(x) \\) exist at every point \\( x \\) in the open interval \\( I \\). For brevity let \\( \\Delta(x,y) \\) denote the difference quotient\n\\[\n\\Delta(x, y) = \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y}\n\\]\nfor any \\( x \\neq y \\) in \\( I \\). Let \\( x < y < z \\) be arbitrary three points in \\( I \\). Applying the inequality stated in \\textbf{Problem 9.4} with \\( \\lambda_1 = z-y, x_1 = x \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = y-x, x_2 = z \\),\n\nwe get \\( y = (\\lambda_1 x_1 + \\lambda_2 x_2)/(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) \\) and\n\\[\nf(y) \\leq \\frac{z-y}{z-x} f(x) + \\frac{y-x}{z-x} f(z).\n\\]\nThus \\( \\Delta(x, y) \\leq \\Delta(y, z) \\). Note that the above inequality can also be written as \\( \\Delta(x, y) \\leq \\Delta(x, z) \\) or as \\( \\Delta(x, z) \\leq \\Delta(y, z) \\). In particular, the quotients \\( \\Delta(x-h, x) \\) and \\( \\Delta(x, x+h) \\) are monotone increasing with respect to \\( h > 0 \\) and \\( \\Delta(x-h, x) \\leq \\Delta(x, x+h) \\) holds for any \\( h > 0 \\) satisfying \\( x \\pm h \\in I \\). This means that both \\( f'_+(x) \\) and \\( f'_-(x) \\) certainly exist and satisfy \\( f'_-(x) \\leq f'_+(x) \\).\n\nNext for any points \\( x < y \\) in \\( I \\) we take a sufficiently small \\( h > 0 \\) satisfying \\( x + h < y - h \\). Then\n\\[\n\\Delta(x, x+h) \\leq \\Delta(x+h, y-h) \\leq \\Delta(y-h, y);\n\\]\nhence, letting \\( h \\to 0^+ \\) we obtain \\( f'_+(x) \\leq f'_-(y) \\). Therefore if \\( f(x) \\) does not possess a finite differential coefficient at \\( x_0 \\), then it follows that \\( f'_-(x_0) < f'_+(x_0) \\). Moreover if we assign the point \\( x_0 \\) to the open interval \\( (f'_-(x_0), f'_+(x_0)) \\), then such intervals are disjoint each other. Therefore we can enumerate all such open intervals by labeling them, for example, in such a way that we count ones contained in \\( (-n, n) \\) and having the length \\( > 1/n \\) for each positive integer \\( n \\). \\(\\square\\)"
