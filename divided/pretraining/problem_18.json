    "problem_type": "Diï¬€erentiation",
    "solution": "Put\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f(x)| \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\beta = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f''(x)|.\n\\]\nWe may of course assume that both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are finite. If $\\beta$ vanishes, then $\\alpha$ is finite if and only if $f(x)$ vanishes everywhere; therefore we can also assume that $\\beta$ is positive. For any $x$ and positive $y$ it follows from Taylor's formula that there is a $\\xi_{x,y}$ satisfying\n\\[\nf(x+y) = f(x) + f'(x)y + f''(\\xi_{x,y}) \\frac{y^2}{2}.\n\\]\nTherefore we have\n\\[\nf(x+y) - f(x-y) = 2f'(x)y + \\left(f''(\\xi_{x,y}) - f''(\\xi_{x,-y})\\right) \\frac{y^2}{2},\n\\]\nwhich implies that\n\\[\n2|f'(x)|y = |f(x+y) - f(x-y) + \\left(f''(\\xi_{x,y}) - f''(\\xi_{x,-y})\\right) \\frac{y^2}{2}|\n\\leq 2\\alpha + \\beta y^2.\n\\]\nThus we get\n\\[\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f'(x)| \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{y} + \\frac{\\beta y}{2},\n\\]\nwhere the right-hand side attains its minimum $\\sqrt{2\\alpha \\beta}$ at $y = \\sqrt{2\\alpha / \\beta}$.\n\nTo see that 2 is the best possible constant we first define an even step function\n\\[\n\\phi''(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{for } |x| > 2, \\\\\n1 & \\text{for } 1 \\leq |x| \\leq 2, \\\\\n-1 & \\text{for } |x| < 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThen\n\\[\n\\phi'(x) = \\int_{-2}^x \\phi''(t) \\, dt\n\\]\nis an odd piecewise linear continuous function and in turn\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\int_{-2}^x \\phi'(t) \\, dt - \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nis an even $C^1$-function. The maxima of $|\\phi(x)|$, $|\\phi'(x)|$ and $|\\phi''(x)|$ are clearly $1/2$, $1$, and $1$ respectively. The equality certainly holds in this example. However $\\phi$ does not belong to $C^2(\\mathbb{R})$. To tide over this difficulty it suffices to transform $\\phi''$ slightly to a continuous one in the neighborhood of the discontinuity points of $\\phi''$ so that its influence on $\\phi$ and $\\phi'$ becomes arbitrarily small."
