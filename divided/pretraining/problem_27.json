    "solution": "Divide the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\) into \\(m \\geq 3\\) equal subintervals. For each subinterval let \\(I'\\) and \\(I''\\) be the left and right neighboring subinterval respectively with \\(I'\\) or \\(I''\\) empty at endpoints. We associate with \\(I\\) the trapezoidal function \\(g_I(x)\\) such that \\(g_I(x) = 1\\) on \\(I\\), \\(g_I(x) = 0\\) on \\([0, 1] \\setminus (I \\cup I' \\cup I'')\\) and that \\(g_I(x)\\) is linear on \\(I'\\) and on \\(I''\\). We thus have \\(m\\) continuous functions \\(g_I\\) for each \\(m\\). We call \\(I\\) the support of \\(g_I\\). Arranging the \\(g_I\\)'s in a line in any manner for \\(m = 3, 4, \\dots\\) we define a sequence of continuous functions \\(\\{f_n(x)\\}\\). It is clear that\n\\[\na_n = \\int_0^1 f_n(x) \\, dx \\leq \\frac{2}{m}\n\\]\nif \\(f_n = g_I\\) and the length of \\(I\\) is equal to \\(1/m\\). Since \\(m \\to \\infty\\) together with \\(n\\), it follows that \\(a_n\\) converges to \\(0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\nFor any point \\(x\\) in \\([0, 1]\\) there are infinitely many cases in which \\(x\\) is contained in some support; in other words, \\(f_n(x) = 1\\) for infinitely many \\(n\\)'s. On the other hand, there are also infinitely many cases in which \\(x\\) is contained in neither the support nor its neighbors; in other words, \\(f_n(x) = 0\\) for infinitely many \\(n\\)'s. Hence \\(\\{f_n(x)\\}\\) does not converge at any point \\(x\\)."
