    "solution": "It follows from\n\\[\n\\left( 1 - 2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right)^2 = 1 - 4x\n\\]\nthat $a_1 = 1$ and the recursion formula\n\\[\na_{n+1} = a_1 a_n + a_2 a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_n a_1\n\\]\nholds for any positive integer $n$. This implies immediately that every $a_n$ is a positive integer; therefore\n\\[\na_{2k+1} = 2(a_1 a_{2k} + \\cdots + a_k a_{k+1})\n\\]\nis an even integer for any positive integer $k$.\n\nSuppose now that there exists a non-negative integer $\\ell$ such that $a_n$ is even for every $n = 2^\\ell(2k+1)$ with $k \\geq 1$. Then\n\\[\na_{2n} = 2(a_1 a_{2n-1} + a_2 a_{2n-2} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} a_{n+1}) + a_n^2\n\\]\nimplies that $a_{2n}$ is also even for every\n\\[\nn = 2^\\ell(2k+1)\n\\]\nwith $k \\geq 1$. Hence by induction every $a_n$ is shown to be even except for the case in which $n$ is a power of $2$. However, if $n$ is a power of $2$, we can similarly show that $a_n$ is odd, since $a_1$ is odd."
