    "solution": "Suppose first that $f'(x)$ is positive for all $x \\geq 0$. Then $f(x)$ is strictly monotone increasing and $f(0) \\geq 0$ because $f'(0)$ is positive. This is a contradiction because $f(x)$ converges to 0 as $x \\to \\infty$. Similarly, we get a contradiction if $f'(x)$ is negative for all $x \\geq 0$. Hence there exists at least one point $x_1 \\geq 0$ at which $f'(x)$ vanishes.\n\nSuppose now that we could find $n$ points $x_1 < \\cdots < x_n$ satisfying $f^{(k)}(x_k) = 0$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. If $f^{(n+1)}(x)$ is positive for any $x > x_n$, then clearly $f^{(n)}(x) \\geq f^{(n)}(x_n + 1) > 0$ for any $x \\geq x_n + 1$, since $f^{(n)}(x_n) = 0$. Thus we have\n\\[\nf(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(x_n + 1)x^n + (\\text{some polynomial of degree less than } n),\n\\]\ncontrary to the assumption that $f(x)$ converges to 0. Similarly, we would have a contradiction if $f^{(n+1)}(x)$ is negative for any $x > x_n$. Hence there exists at least one point $x_{n+1}$ greater than $x_n$ satisfying $f^{(n+1)}(x_{n+1}) = 0$."
