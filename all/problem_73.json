    "problem": "Deduce the approximation theorem by trigonometric polynomials from Weierstrass' approximation theorem by polynomials.",
    "problem_type": "Approximation by Polynomials",
    "solution": "For any continuous periodic function with period $2\\pi$, we write $f(x) = f_+(x) + f_-(x)$ where \n\\[\nf_{\\pm}(x) = \\frac{f(x) \\pm f(-x)}{2}\n\\]\nrespectively. $f_{\\pm}$ are also continuous periodic functions with the same period satisfying $f_+(-x) = f_+(x)$ and $f_-(x) + f_-(k\\pi) = 0$. Note that $f_-(k\\pi) = 0$ for any integer $k$.\n\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$ we can take a continuous odd function $\\phi(x)$ with period $2\\pi$ such that $|f_-(x) - \\phi(x)| < \\epsilon$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and that $\\phi(x)$ vanishes on every point of some small neighborhoods of the points $k\\pi$. Since $x = \\arccos y$ maps the interval $[-1,1]$ onto $[0,\\pi]$ homeomorphically, the functions \n\\[\nf_+(\\arccos y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\phi(\\arccos y)}{\\sin(\\arccos y)}\n\\]\nare continuous on the interval $[-1,1]$. Thus applying Weierstrass' approximation theorem to these functions, we can find certain polynomials $P(y)$ and $Q(y)$ satisfying\n\\[\n|f_+(x) - P(\\cos x)| < \\epsilon \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left|\\phi(x) - (\\sin x) Q(\\cos x)\\right| < \\epsilon\n\\]\nfor any $0 \\leq x \\leq \\pi$. Moreover the inequalities hold for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by the evenness of $f_+(x)$ and $P(\\cos x)$, by the oddness of $\\phi(x)$ and $(\\sin x) Q(\\cos x)$ and, of course,\n\nby the periodicity of these functions. We therefore obtain \n\\[\n|f(x) - P(\\cos x) - (\\sin x) Q(\\cos x)| \\leq |f_+(x) - P(\\cos x)| + |f_-(x) - \\phi(x)| + |\\phi(x) - (\\sin x)Q(\\cos x)|\n< 3\\epsilon\n\\]\nfor any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Finally it is easily verified that each $\\cos^k x$ can be written as a linear combination of $1, \\cos x, \\ldots, \\cos kx$ and that each $(\\sin x) \\cos^k x$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $\\sin x, \\sin 2x, \\ldots, \\sin kx$. This completes the proof."
